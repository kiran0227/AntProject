Executable WAR Sample Project
=============================

This is a sample project that uses the executable-war package available at
http://github.com/jeanfric/executable-war.

To build, you will need to fetch a copy of the executable-war project, then
install it with Maven.

You can then build this very project using Maven.  Once this is done, you can
simply run the WAR file that appears in the target/ directory as such:

 $ java -jar target/executable-war-sample-*.war

You should be able to see "Hello World!" at http://localhost:8080/.

Or you can simply deploy the WAR file to any servlet container, and get the same
result when visiting the application with a browser.
